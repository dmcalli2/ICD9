There are 1178 ICD9 codes at 3 digit level and all of these are present in ICD9CM. However the following 9 codes are present in ICD9CM but not in ICD9:

|CODE | Label|
|-----|-------|
|042 | Human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] disease|
|113|Actinomycosis|
|176|Kaposi's sarcoma|
|677|Late effect of complication of pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium|
|E849|Place of occurrence|
|V08|Asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection status|
|V09|Infection with drug-resistant microorganisms|
|V29|Observation and evaluation of newborns for suspected condition not found|
|V69|Problems related to lifestyle|

The HIV and Kaposi codes are likely to reflect the fact that HIV was not defined at the time ICD9 was introduced. The purpose of the other codes is uncertain to us. Both ICD9 and ICD9CM have 039 (actinomycotic infections) but the distinction between this and actinomycosis (113 in ICD9CM) is not clear.

While ICD9 and ICD9CM are very similar at three digit level this isnâ€™t true at the five digit level. At this level there are 17,810 codes in ICD9CM, of which only 9,373 (53%) are also in ICD9. However there are 435 codes that are in ICD9 that are not in ICD9CM.
